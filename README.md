# smart-text-editor
this is smart-text-editor with some of technologies such as :
 

# flesch code generator : 
                  it will generate flesch code of data .
                  in simpler terms it is a measure of how easy your text is (to understand )? 
#  markov text generator :
                (it generates the text depending on how good you train it).   

# autocompletion:
                (for every un-complete word it will suggest some possible completions).
 
# autocorrect :
              (implies that it will show a list of misspelled words in the text and their right substitutions )
# edit distance :
            which you tell you : in how many steps you can change word_one into another_word and most 
            exciting thing is , it will show you whole path that you get into another_word from first.
            i implemented  this without using dynamic programming algorithm , instead  of that i have 
            used datastuctures(trees).

# to see this functioning , i will strongly recommend you to use eclipse ide along with javafx installed.

# to run the editor : run application -> MainApp.java
