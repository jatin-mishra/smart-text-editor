# smart-text-editor
this is smart-text-editor with some of functionalities such as :
 

# flesch code generator : 
                  it will generate flesch code of data .
                  in simpler terms it is a measure of how easy your text is (to understand )? 
#  markov text generator :
                (it generates the future text depending on how good you train it).   

# autocompletion:
                (for every un-complete word it will suggest some possible meaningfull completions).
 
# autocorrect :
              (implies that it will show a list of misspelled words in the text and their right meaningfull substitutions )
# edit distance :
            which will tell you : in how many steps you can change word_one into another_word and most 
            exciting thing is , it will show you whole path that you get into another_word from first.
            i implemented  this without using dynamic programming algorithm , instead  of that i have 
            used datastuctures(trees). it will not take any random change, instead it will take steps 
            where each produced word should be meaningfull and so that asked input words also should be 
            meaningfull.

# to see it's functioning , i will strongly recommend you to use eclipse ide along with javafx installed.

# to run the editor : run application -> MainApp.java
